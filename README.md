**ProHike is a full-stack, multi-industry project showcase and hiring platform that empowers individuals to get discovered, hired, or funded based on what they build — not what they memorize.**

## 💡 The Vision: Hiring 2.0

Traditional hiring is broken. It filters out exceptional, self-taught talent because of biased resume templates and a flawed focus on memorized algorithms. Millions of creators—engineers, designers, filmmakers, and architects—have brilliant projects but no single platform to prove their skills in a structured, hireable format.

**ProHike fixes this.**

We are building a future where your work speaks for itself. Where a student from a small town has the same opportunity as someone from a top-tier institution because their project is undeniable. This is a true meritocracy. This is "Proof of Skill," not "Proof of Work."
